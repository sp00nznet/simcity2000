# Contributing

This is a recompilation project, which changes what a useful contribution looks
like. Three rules matter more than the rest.

## No game files, ever

Nothing from the SimCity 2000 disc goes in the repository, in any form: no
executable, DLL, city, tile set, sound or data file, and nothing regenerated
from one -- no lifted source, disassembly listing, IDA export, reconstructed
header, or test file with a lifted function in it.

The tool ships; the disc does not. Everyone brings their own copy and points
the tools at it. `.gitignore` covers `game/`, `original/`, `analysis/*.json` and
`src/recomp/gen/`; if something slips past it, that is a bug worth reporting on
its own.

Screenshots and recordings of the game running are fine, and are the point of
the README.

## Where your code comes from

Contributions have to be your own work or under a licence compatible with MIT.
The live risk is a fix ported from a GPL or LGPL project, which would relicense
it by accident and is very hard to untangle later. The ones most likely to be
open next to this are **Wine** (LGPL), the pcrecomp siblings' xemu-derived code
(LGPL), and the OpenSC2K family -- the original is MIT, but at least one fork is
GPL-3, so check the licence of the copy you are reading. Reading them to understand a behaviour is
fine; copying code from them is not. If something in your PR came from
somewhere, say where.

## Claims are measured, not assumed

The oracle is `--native`: it runs the original `SIMCITY.EXE` on the same hidden
desktop, with the same recorder and input script, as the recompiled one. A
change that claims to fix a behaviour should say what the original does in the
same scenario, and a change to the lifter belongs in
[pcrecomp](https://github.com/sp00nznet/pcrecomp), with a `difftest` case.

## The usual

- Imperative commit subjects; the body explains *why* when it is not obvious.
- Community pull requests are merged with a merge commit, never squashed or
  rebased, so your commits stay yours. Anything the maintainer adds goes in
  separate commits on top.
- Comments explain the reasoning, not the syntax: a comment recording how
  something was found out is worth more than one restating the line under it.
- AI-assisted contributions are welcome, provided a human understood and
  verified the change -- ran it, and can say what it does.
